## Justin Edwards - Mastery Coding Resources

This is my **GitHub Repository (Repo)** for my **Mastery Coding Classes.** It will be a place for students to find information about me, contact information, and instructional resources for each lesson.

## About Me

My background is varied in Information / Instructional Technology, but mostly Data Analysis. I instruct part-time for Mastery Coding teaching Game Design, Web Development, etc to K-12 students across the nation.

Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors: kayaking, shooting sports, astronomy, etc... My wife and I have also been attending local jam sessions and I am learning to play the cajon.

## Mastery Coding

We believe that curriculum should culminate in students being self-sufficient and capable of designing and building a software application from scratch. Our teaching approach gradually releases responsibility from the course materials onto the student using project-based learning. Students are motivated to learn real skills and topics because they can create increasingly impressive projects using real industry tools and technologies. This way, the "how does this topic relate to me" barrier that often impedes learning in other STEM topics is gently removed.
